Homework 4

Design
1
The most helpful thing when thinking of the design and architecture of the project was being able to diagram the project using UML. This helped team members clearly articulate their ideas and ensured that everyone was on the same page.
2
The most difficult part about the design was determining how to store the user's information. This was challenging because of the abundance of options available. We decided to use a locally stored config file because the user's work flows did not need to interact with other users. I think we would use the same approach, but I think using .json would be better than what we did use, yaml.
3
A design method that we used for this project that was helpful was sketching out a cartoon-like storyboard of the users interaction with our software. This helped solidify the outcome we were looking to create. This helped guide the entire design experience.
.
Testing
1
Integration tests were particularly helpful for this project because it allowed us to collaborate more efficiently. However this was done manually. We would work on sections, and then when we merged the code, run through the user flows.
2
The most difficult part was maintaining consistent testing practices. We did not use unit tests so the testing was done manually. This was slight issue, but the number of manual tests were low, so it did no become a big problem as the code base grew.
3
integration testing was crucial, I wll use that again when I inevitably work on larger projects with more developers. I do believe that we should have implemented unit testing to make this process quicker. In the future I will use unit testing, it will allow me to work on segments of the code without worries of breaking conflicts.
.
Process
1
Scrum-ban was helpful because it helped us divide tasks and keep track of progress. We were able to help each other by seeing which tasks people were currently working on.
2
The most difficult part was planning so far ahead what tasks would need to be done. When new tasks popped up, we would have to add them to the scum-ban, which helped, but it made estimating the time difficult.
3
I will use the scum-ban technique in the future. It was helpful to keep track of the progress being made, and helped the team communicate.
.
Overall
The testing and development practices that we used for this project helped us succeed. There were weaknesses with our testing, but in the end it did not prevent us from writing code in organized development process.
The kan-ban was helpful, some benefits included improved communication and collaboration between team mates and less confusion about what needed to be done.
There were some drawbacks, the testing, but ultimately they did not prevent us from accomplishing the assignment.
